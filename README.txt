This is a simple game of "Guess the Number". The computer randomly 'guesses' a number between 0 and 100 exclusive. Game is done in Javscript.

The player then attempts to guess the computer's 'guess' and keeps at it until (s)he correctly guesses it.

If the player's choice is nearer to the computer's, the player is shown the message "Getting Hotter". Conversely, if the player's choice is getting further from the computer's, the message shown is "Getting Cooler"


The player's final score is evaluated according to the number of guesses taken to correctly guess the Computer's choice.

Enjoy!
